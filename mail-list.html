<h1>Mailing Lists</h1>
Sakai community members share expert advice and provide mutual support on a daily basis through a set of mailing lists. 

For help with technical questions, the Development discussion group (a.k.a Sakai-Dev) is the most active, but many others are available, ranging from teaching and learning to user experience. 

Visit the <a href=http://collab.sakaiproject.org/mailman/listinfo> Email Lists page </a>for more information.

 organizations have many different choices for support. Some choose  to 
install, host and maintain the software themselves with help from  the 
rest of the Sakai community while others choose to work with  commercial
 providers that provide Sakai services.</p>
<p>We invite you to explore the <a href="http://www.sakaiproject.org/node/2337">Community Support</a> and <a href="http://www.sakaiproject.org/node/2338">Commercial Support</a> information.</p><p></p></body></html>

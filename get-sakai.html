<h1>Get Sakai</h1>
<p>
Sakai is available in two distribution forms:  binary and source.  The binary distribution is a pre-packaged form of Saka that has everything you need to set up a demonstration verison of the Collaboration Learning Environment (CLE).  While it is a fully functioning Sakai, it is not recommended for production use.
<p>
If you'd like to start setting up Sakai for production use, the source distribution is recommended.  The installation instructions will tell you how to download the Sakai course files, build them, and configure the system for the database of your choice (MySQL or Oracle).

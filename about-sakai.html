<h1>About Sakai</h1>

Sakai is a vibrant community creating technology that enhances teaching, learning and research.

The global community comes together to define needs of academic users, create software tools, share best practices and pool knowledge and resources in support of this goal.

Each day, community members share thousands of interactions: building and improving the software; requesting help; collaborating on projects; and enjoying the relationships that result from this work.
